        </h2>
        <p>
          <p>Ever since it was <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-6-3-mapping-request-data-to-typed-objects" target="_blank">introduced</a>,
the functionality for mapping request data to DTOs has been my favourite Symfony 6.3 new feature. The new 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[MapRequestPayload]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#[MapQueryString]</code> attributes allow us to delegate the DTO instantiation to the framework, 
instead of doing it manually in the controllers - for example when instantiating commands to be dispatched to a command 
bus. However, I realized that most of the commands in my application contain additional properties which are not 
directly mapped to the request data - such as the ID of the currently authenticated user. In this article, we’ll see how
we can enhance the process to be able to resolve the unmapped values in such cases.</p>

          <p>Over time, as our application grows, the controllers can become cluttered with repeated exception handling code. In this 
article we’ll see how we can have both cleaner controller methods when using the Symfony framework by centralizing the 
exception handling, and cleaner domain exceptions by only declaring custom PHP attributes on their classes.</p>

        <p>
          <p>In my <a href="/2022/01/09/custom-php-attributes-for-symfony-messenger-handlers.html">previous post</a>, we saw that by using 
custom PHP attributes, we can have our Symfony Messenger message handlers placed in any service in our application. The 
only requirement for the message handlers is for them to be methods that are able to receive the message object as an 
argument. In this post we will see how we can avoid that requirement, and register any method as a message handler, by 
automatically passing any of the message’s properties as values for the handler’s arguments.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2022/01/09/custom-php-attributes-for-symfony-messenger-handlers.html">Using custom PHP attributes for registering and configuring Symfony Messenger handlers</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <p>Symfony Messenger provides multiple ways for registration and configuration of message handlers. Nowadays, the handlers 
are usually registered by implementing the component’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MessageHandlerInterface</code> interface, which makes the handlers 
auto-configurable by default, or by implementing some interface of ours which we can register for autoconfiguration 
manually. However, with the addition of the attributes functionality in PHP 8.0, it doesn’t really make sense anymore to 
use interfaces for the purpose of “describing” our classes. In this article we’ll explore how we can use our own PHP 
attributes to register and configure the message handlers.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          <p>Although we’ve been using annotations in PHP for years, this functionality was not part of the language itself. Instead, 
we had to rely on parsing the comments formatted as docblocks above the classes, properties or methods, usually with the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doctrine/annotations</code> library. With the acceptance of the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2">“Attributes v2” RFC</a> 
for the next major PHP version, the concept will become part of the PHP core, called “Attributes” and with slightly 
different syntax: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;Example&gt;&gt;</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Example</code>. In this article we’ll see how we can use a custom attribute to 
tell Symfony how to resolve the currently authenticated user as controller action argument even if we don’t use the 
security component.</p>

          <p>The user checkers in the Symfony Security component allow us to control whether an user can be authenticated in our system,

          <p>When I started working on my biggest side project, the “EESTEC Platform for Local Committees” I introduced <a href="/2014/08/05/introducing-eestec-platform-for-local-committees.html">a few months ago</a>, the latest stable version of Laravel was 4.2. Over the past weeks, Taylor introduced many great changes and new features that we’ll be able to use in the new version, firstly numbered 4.3 and later 5. According to the framework’s six month release cycle, it should had hit stable late this month or in early December. Because of that, I started to play with it and to apply the changes to make my application use it.</p>

          <p>“EESTEC Platform” is a web application which will aim to ease the internal management of EESTEC’s local committees.
